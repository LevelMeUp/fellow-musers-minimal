Media Consumption
- Continued Reading Outsiders, by Howard Becker. Great book, more to follow
- Read the review for [The Historian](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Historian-Elizabeth-Kostova/dp/0751537284) and decided it wasn't for me
- Rediscovered Burial Untrue album and listened to it approximately 20 times
- Tried in vain to work out what song Declan McKenna - Brazil reminds me of. Like a love child of Razorlight, Vampire Weekend, still bugging me
- Downloaded Andrew O'Hagan - Mayflies
- Watched [Roadhouse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0ZsLudtfjI&ab_channel=PrimeVideo) which I went in blind to. Bonkers bonkers film. C from me. Ridiculous. Pulp at its finest, but pretty shite

Musings & good reads
- https://interconnected.org/home/2024/04/05/driving was my favourite blog post of the week. "It does a disservice to this cognitive state to believe that it can be found only with psychedelics or meditation or whatever, whereas there are mundane apertures too"
